Financial Projector

The financial projector is an ASP.NET MVC application which allows the effects of various financial decisions to be "projected" over time. Everything that contributes to our monthly cashflow can be entered into the system - things from which we receive money such as a job, income from property or other assets, and things which cost us money, such as rent, bills or general spending.  Then either a year at a time or a full decade at a time can be viewed and the system calculates the monthly "cashflow" - how much extra money we have (or how much less money we have) and also a running total of how much actual cash we should have.

The system is up and running at http://finproj.azurewebsites.net.  The user is encouraged to try out the demo first,
then register for a free account in order to keep track of their own data.

The system is written using ASP.NET MVC / C# / Entity Framework and hosted on Windows Azure.
